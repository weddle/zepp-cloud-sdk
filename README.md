# Zepp Cloud Python SDK

High-quality, typed, sync+async Python SDK for Zepp/Amazfit cloud surfaces, with first-class offline export and optional TSDB sinks.

## Status
- Early scaffolding in progress.
- Repo contains legal/policy docs, docs landing page, agent guidelines, `.gitignore`, `tmp/`, and a local `.venv/` (ignored).
- No published package yet; API and transports not implemented.

## Next Step
- Sprint 0: scaffold packaging and tooling.
  - Add `pyproject.toml` with PEP 621 + setuptools-scm.
  - Create `src/zepp_cloud/` package skeleton and CLI entrypoint.
  - Configure Ruff (lint+fmt), MyPy (strict), Pytest, and pre-commit.
  - Set up GitHub Actions CI (3.9â€“3.13) running lint, type-check, tests, coverage.

We will update this README after each major milestone.

## Local Development (temporary)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
python -m pip install -U pip
```

### Local Dev Loop
Run formatter, linter (with autofix), then tests:
```bash
ruff format .
ruff check . --fix
pytest -q
```

Pre-commit (local only) also runs Ruff format, Ruff lint (autofix), and MyPy:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## CI Roadmap
- Current CI: single smoke job on pushes to `main` and PRs; installs minimal deps, runs Ruff format check, Ruff lint, and `pytest -q`.
- Reintroduce later, in order:
  1) Coverage gate with a modest threshold
  2) MyPy in CI
  3) Python version matrix
  4) Extras needed by integration tests
